# Python Physics Projects

Welcome to the Python Physics Projects repository! This collection of projects showcases various simulations and computations related to classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and computational physics using Python.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- [`classical_mechanics/`](classical_mechanics/): Contains projects related to classical mechanics.
- [`quantum_mechanics/`](quantum_mechanics/): Contains projects related to quantum mechanics.
- [`computational_physics/`](computational_physics/): Contains various projects related to computational physics.

Each directory includes its own `README.md` with detailed information about the projects contained within.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. It is also recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies for each project.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project-directory

2. Create a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv myenv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   source myenv/bin/activate

4. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the project:
   python project_file.py


Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a project or simulation youâ€™d like to add, please fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request.
